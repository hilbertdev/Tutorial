    How to use git commit: 

    git add . =>git commit => click 'i' to enter INSERT mode and then enter a comment => press escape => enter ":wq"
    
    Shorter way to use the commit command: 
    1. git add . 
    2. git commit -m 'insert comment'

    When you switch back to the master file coming from the a branch, the file in the branch is deleted 

    Merge the two branches to be able to view both of them

    Problem: Could not push my local repo to my remote repo 
    error: Unrelated histories error 
    solution: git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories 

    Why unrelated histories?
As clear from the error message, it happens when some one try to merge two unrelated projects (projects which do not know about each other and commit history in one project does not match with other project.). Until now I am aware of two scenarios when this error can occur.

You have cloned a project and some how you have lost your .git directory or somehow .git got corrupted. You local history is gone and git is not happy with it.
OR

You have create a brand new repository, added few commits and now you are trying to pull from some remote repository which already has some commits.
Unrelated histories can be fixed in two ways.

allow-unrelated-histories switch
You can simple use allow-unrelated-histories with pull. This will merge remote history first followed by your commit.

git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories


Problem: How to resolve git error: “Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind”
Solution: Pull the master branch on your remote server first to ensure it merge with the local branch. 

This is how you add a remote repo on your pc: 
git remote add 'name of repo' url
